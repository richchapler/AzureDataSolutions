## Resource Instantiation

I have tried to keep these instructions free of the obvious:

* When the interface says **Subscription**, use the dropdown to select the appropriate subscription
* When the interface says **Resource Group**, select the appropriate resource group
* When the interface says **Region** (or something similar like **Location**), select the same region used by the resource group (or a different value, if appropriate)
* When the interface asks for a **Name**, enter a meaningful name aligned with standards
* When I mention that you need to use a resource {e.g., a Key Vault}, this should imply that you will need to have instantiated a Key Vault
