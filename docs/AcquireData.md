## Acquire Data

Data acquisition is complex, if for no other reason than the fact that there are so many combinations of source, target, and method. Only a few of these are included here.

### No Code

  ["One-Click" Ingestion](AcquireData_NoCode_OneClickIngestion.md) | Data Lake | Data Explorer | "One-Click Ingestion Wizard"<br>
  "Copy Data Tool" (WIP) | Data Lake | Synapse, Dedicated SQL Pool | "Built-in copy task"

### Low Code

  [Azure API, Cost Management](AcquireData_LowCode_AzureAPI_CostManagement.md) | Azure API | Data Lake | Synapse Pipeline
